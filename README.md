# Planarian chromosome assembly analysis scripts.

This folder has the code used to analyse the dn/ds and inversions in
the chromosome level assembly presented in Guo et al.

notebooks/planaria\_dn\_ds.py.ipynb - performs dn/ds analysis
py\_scripts/identify\_span\_reads\_masked.py - identifies inversion spanning reads on chromosome 1 with the masked genome   
py\_scripts/identify\_span\_reads\_unmasked.py - identifies inversion spanning reads on chromosome 1 with the unmasked genome
